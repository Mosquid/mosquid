# Welcome to github.com/mosquid

My name is Dmitry Platonov, I am an AI-enhanced developer and I like to geek out over all things code. I build software for a living, prototype software for the sake of learning, and mentor for the sake of giving back.
Currently a founding team member of [A.Team](https://a.team/).

You're welcome here, and let's keep in touch:
