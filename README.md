# Welcome to github.com/mosquid


_I didnâ€™t know that, but apparently if you create a GitHub repo with your handle and readme.md file in the root, it turns into your GitHub profile page like this one._

My name is Dmitry Mosquid and I am a software engineer (or rather a web developer) with a passion for technological detective challenges (e.g. Dima, take a look, I got a super weird bug).

I can be applicable in designing complex web applications, consulting on infrastructure, or building MVPs. If you are interested in any of these, do not hesitate to get in touch.
