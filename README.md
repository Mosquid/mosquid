# Welcome to github.com/mosquid


_I didnâ€™t know that but apparently when you create a GitHub repo with a name matching your handle and `README.md` file in the root, it turns into your GitHub profile page just like this one._

My name is Dmitry Platonov and I am a software engineer (or rather a web developer) with a passion for technological detective challenges.

I can be applicable in designing complex web applications, consulting on infrastructure, or building MVPs. If you are interested in any of these, do not hesitate to get in touch.
