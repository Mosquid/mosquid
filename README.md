# Welcome to github.com/mosquid

My name is Dmitry Platonov and I do things with the Code. I create software for a living, prototype software for the sake of learning, and mentor for giving back.
Currently, I'm a part of a founding team at [A.Team](https://a.team/). 

You are welcome here and feel free to get in touch:
